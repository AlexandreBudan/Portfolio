                    <p class="blog-post-meta">How did it start?</p>

                    <p>Initially, I looked for an internship in my field of interest. I was looking for an internship in
                        back-end development and Tcp Innovation contacted me following one of my Linkedin posts,
                        offering me tasks such as Php, Python and CMS use.</p>
                    <p>After a 3-hour face-to-face interview with them, I was finally told that I'd been accepted and
                        could do a 2-month internship with them.</p>
                    <hr>
                    <h2>Next step</h2>
                    <br>
                    <p>How did my internship go and why did I stop after a week?</p>
                    <blockquote class="blockquote">
                        <p>This is simple.</p>
                    </blockquote>
                    <p>The tasks that were initially planned did not respect what was initially planned and noted on the
                        internship agreement. Nor did the company's environment allow trainees to develop and work in an
                        appropriate manner.</p>
                    <p>Here's a list of some of the tasks I've been assigned, which I'll come back to in more detail in
                        the article “A typical day at TCP”:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Assignments for marketing communication students</li>
                        <li>Day-long documentation production</li>
                        <li>Modification of the boss's workspace in his own words</li>
                    </ul>
                    <hr>
                    <h2>How did it work out?</h2>
                    <br>
                    <p>After a few days of carrying out tasks that I considered to be on the verge of slavery, I turned
                        myself in to my fellow trainees who were with me.</p>
                    <p>In fact, there were 5 trainees and 2 employees, including the boss, so I was able to talk to them
                        and ask them if this was normal and that maybe it was just the beginning, that it would get
                        better.</p>
                    <p>They confided in me that it was the same for them and that they had been enduring it for several
                        weeks too.</p>
                    <p>So I took the step of breaking the internship contract by invoking one of the articles of the law
                        in the Education Code. By the end of the week, all the trainees, including me, had drawn up our
                        termination notice.</p>
                        <hr>
                    <h2>To conclude</h2>
                    <br>
                    <p>Afterwards, we all tried to get him to sign our severance agreement, which he of course refused
                        to do. In particular, he blamed one of the trainees, saying that he had turned us all against
                        him and would not sign the agreements.</p>
                    <p>I tried many times to contact him again, whether it was the boss or my internship supervisor,
                        with no response from either of them.</p>
                    <p>So I decided to move on. I tried to find another internship, but in my situation it wasn't
                        possible, and since I'd already found my work-study placement, I still passed my second year.
