                <article class="blog-post">
                    <h2 class="display-5 link-body-emphasis mb-1">Documentation</h2>
                    <p class="blog-post-meta">"Everything is documentation"</p>

                    <p>In fact, TCP documents every aspect of daily life, which I agree is not a bad thing. However,
                        none of this documentation is checked by the boss, which leaves room for a few inconsistencies
                        between trainees and employees.</p>
                    <p>So, here's a typical day at TCP as it was presented to me.</p>
                    <hr>
                    <h2>The morning</h2>
                    <br>
                    <p>Arrival time at the premises is 9 a.m. Ideally, you should arrive 15 minutes beforehand, so as to
                        be ready for the morning meeting.</p>
                    <p>meeting is a daily with 3 different positions assigned in turn:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Leader: in charge of running the meeting</li>
                        <li>The Co-leader: in charge of taking notes on everyone's tasks.</li>
                        <li>The back-up: if the Leader or Co-Leader is absent, he takes his place.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <hr>
                    <h2>Assigning the tasks of the day</h2>
                    <br>
                    <p>This point is, I think, very important to deal with, that's why it takes the place of a
                        paragraph.</p>
                    <p>Indeed, it was the interns' job to assign themselves their own tasks and have them validated by
                        the boss. However, when we don't know what to work on, we were put back in our place by the boss
                        who said that we hadn't done our work.</p>
                    <p>So, I assigned myself tasks where I could find them and the simple fact of having found a task
                        whatever it was, the boss said nothing.</p>
                    <p>Unless I'm mistaken, I don't really understand how a boss doesn't give his interns anything to do
                        at the base.</p>
                    <hr>
                    <h2>My first task</h2>
                    <br>
                    <p>When I arrived, I was asked to do the documentation for newcomers. I thought I would face a
                        tutorial that would guide me step by step to enter the company or at least a documentation
                        explaining how to use the different tools.</p>
                    <blockquote class="blockquote">
                        <p>But no.</p>
                    </blockquote>
                    <p>Instead, I had a totally empty documentation, dotted with a few lines or points that I was asked
                        to do for future newcomers without even knowing the tools that I had to explain.</p>
                    <hr>
                    <h2>The rest of the day</h2>
                    <br>
                    <p>During the rest of the day, after finishing the meeting until the end of the day, I had to
                        complete my tasks that I had been assigned which consisted of 90% of documentation to do and
                        fill out for future new arrivals.</p>
                    <p>The day ended at 6pm with of course a 2-hour break in the middle.</p>
                    <p>I would still like to point out that the first day, the boss made us work until 6pm with only one
                        hour of break (i.e. 8 hours of work in one day), which is normally forbidden but if we left
                        before we were allowed to have a reflection such as "do you have a bus to catch?".</p>
